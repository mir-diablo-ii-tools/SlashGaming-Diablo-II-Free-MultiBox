# SlashGaming Diablo II Free Multibox
This is a project aimed at modding Diablo II to uncap the number of concurrent game process instances permitted on a system.

## Usage
The DLL does nothing on its own and must be loaded into the game via external tools.

It is highly not recommended to use this online. It is possible to be detected by anti-cheat systems and be banned for unauthorized modification of the game client.

This project supports nearly every version of Diablo II since 1.00. The latest version of Diablo II that is supported is 1.14D.

## Contribution
SGD2FreeMultibox is coded in C89. It currently is intended to compile with Visual C++ 6.0.

The linker needs to be configured to link the DLL to version.lib, MDCc.lib, and SGD2MAPIc.lib.
